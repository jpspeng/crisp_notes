**R** is a programming language and software environment specifically designed for 
statistical computing, data analysis, and graphical representation. **RStudio** is
an integrated development environment 
(IDE) for R. It provides a user-friendly interface that makes working with R 
easier and more efficient. We will need both for the CRISP course. 

For instructions on how to install, please read this page
