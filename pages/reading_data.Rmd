Say that you have a dataset. The first step is to read in data into `R`. You can do
this using the `read.csv()` function. 

The easiest way to use this function is to put the data file in the **same folder** 
as your R code. Otherwise, you may have to include the directory path to the data in the argument when
calling `read.csv()`. 

```{r}
# if data is in the same folder 

# if data is in a different folder
```

After reading in the data, you can print the dataset by just referencing
the variable in a code chunk.
